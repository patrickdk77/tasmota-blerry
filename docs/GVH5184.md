Working notes - reverse engineering data stream for GVH5184


Working on the code for the 4-probe Govee driver.  NOTE - any code is intended as psuedo-code and is not syntax correct.

The full 'p' string that comes from BLE looks like this:

0201060303518414FF363E5D01000101E40106FFFFFFFF06FFFFFFFF

Breaking that down: (ref - https://community.silabs.com/s/article/kba-bt-0201-bluetooth-advertising-data-basics?language=en_US)

```
02 01 06    03 03 51 84    14 FF


02 01 06 
-- -- -- <- Two bytes (02), Type = Flags (01), Value (06) (bitwise -  00000110) Bit 1 : “LE General Discoverable Mode”
                                                                                Bit 2: “BR/EDR Not Supported.”

03 03 51 84
-- -- -- -- <- Three bytes (03), Type = Service Class (03), Little endian.  84 51 - not in the list of 16Bit UUIDs.  Perhaps Manuf cheated and just put model number here instead.  It is the 5184 sensor.

14 FF
-- -- <- 20 Bytes (0x14), Type = FF - Manuf. Proprietary data
This is what we were looking for.  All data after the 14 FF will be data we can break up for sensor data.
```

The remaining string to be manipulated:

36 3E 5D 01 00 01 01 E4 01 06 FF FF FF FF 06 FF FF FF FF

```
1  2  3 (Byte Sequence)
36 3E 5D
-- -- -- <- Last 3 bytes of MAC ADDRESS

          4  5  6  7     
          01 00 01 01 
          -- -- -- -- <- static, unknown, not needed at this time

                      8
                      E4
                      -- <- Battery Percentage Value divided by 255 for percentage.

                         9
                         01
                         -- <- Sequence number.  Can be 01 or 02.  01 is Probe1&2.  02 is Probe3&4.

                            10  
                            06
                            -- <- Probe1/3 status.  06 is no probe.  86 is probe inserted.  C6 when probe has exceeded setpoint

                               11 12  
                               FF FF
                               -- -- <- Probe1/3 temp.  FF FF if not inserted.  Big-endian 2-byte number.  See below.

                                     13 14  
                                     FF FF
                                     -- -- <- Probe1/3 set point for alarm. Same scheme as temp.

                                           15
                                           06
                                           -- <- Probe2/4 status. 06 is no probe.  86 is probe inserted.

                                              16 17  
                                              FF FF
                                              -- -- <- Probe2/4 temp.  Same scheme as Probe 1/3

                                                    18 19  
                                                    FF FF
                                                    -- -- <- Probe2/4 set point for alarm. Same scheme as temp.
```

We now can build out a sensor data stream to encode and push back through MQTT

```
BYTE8 - Battery %. 0x00-0xFF, 0-255 - Battery percentage is (VALUE / 255)
BYTE9 - Sequence.  Either 01 or 02.  01 represents Probes 1 & 2.  02 represents probes 3 & 4.
BYTE10 - Probe[A] Status.  [A] is 1 when Sequence is 1. [A] is 3 when Sequence is 2.
          Possible Values.  06 - no probe inserted.   86 - Probe inserted normal function.  C6 - probe temp has exceeded set point.
BYTE11-12 - Probe[A] Temp.  Two bytes - big endian - convert to decimal and divide by 100 to obtain temperature in (C).
BYTE13-14 - Probe[A] Setpoint.  Two bytes - big endian.  Same conversion.  Temp to alarm at.  Will set status to C6 when temp >= setpoint
BYTE15 - Probe[B] Status.  [A] is 1 when Sequence is 1. [A] is 3 when Sequence is 2.
          Possible Values.  06 - no probe inserted.   86 - Probe inserted normal function.  C6 - probe temp has exceeded set point.
BYTE16-17 - Probe[B] Temp.  Two bytes - big endian - convert to decimal and divide by 100 to obtain temperature in (C).
BYTE18-19 - Probe[B] Setpoint.  Two bytes - big endian.  Same conversion.  Temp to alarm at.  Will set status to C6 when temp >= setpoint
```



Building on other driver files, the following approach will be used.

1) Iterate through the string and find 14 and FF.  Assign the remaing 19 bytes to a variable.

2) We need to check if anything is changed so we don't do needless updates.  So we will always need a last_value and current_value. If
they are the same we can end and not update anything.

3) Declare last_value = stored ['last_value']

4) Check to see if last_value is empty - which means we are on our first pass and need to create a placeholder

5) If last_value does not yet exist - declare "last_value" and assign negative values for later test.)
    Last value will be a date structure list with the following values stored in the list.  This is a list and not a map
    so these names are just for documentation.  It will be a list of 12 INT values.
```
      [ Probe1 Status,
        Probe1 Temp,
        Probe1 Setpoint,
        Probe2 Status,
        Probe2 Temp,
        Probe2 Setpoint
        Probe3 Status,
        Probe3 Temp,
        Probe3 Setpoint,
        Probe4 Status,
        Probe4 Temp,
        Probe4 Setpoint ]
```     

5) Now we need to see if the current 'p' value is carrying the values for Probe1/2 or Probe3/4.  Since we only get half the probes on any pass - we
  have to parse out the values and push them into our current_value list based on which sequence we are on.  Check for sequence.

```
   If .get(8,-1) == 1 then #This is BYTE9 which contains the sequence number)
      sequence_index=0
   else
      sequence_index=6
```

6) Now we can use sequence index as an offset.  This will allow us to reuse the same block of code regardless of which sequence we are on.
```
      current_value[sequence_index] = .get((9+sequence_index),-1)
      current_value[sequence_index+1] = .get((10+sequence_index),-2)
      current_value[sequence_index+2] = .get((12+sequence_index),-2)
      current_value[sequence_index+3] = .get((14+sequence_index),-1)
      current_value[sequence_index+4] = .get((15+sequence_index),-2)
      current_value[sequence_index+5] = .get((17+sequence_index),-2)
```

7) Now we can compare current_value to last_value.  Both contain a complete set of 12 discrete values.  If the same return 0.

8) If they are not the same we will need to publish the updated data.  At this point - it is unclear if there is any advantage or disadvantage of publishing
all 12 pieces of data.  If we do discovery on Probe1/2 and Probe3/4 separtely and publish values for each separately - then we would not have entities for 
Probe 3/4 if they are not plugged in.  TBD.
